# Fetch Frontend Take-Home Exercise

This is my submission for the Fetch Frontend Take-Home Exercise.

This is an app for finding the perfect shelter dog to adopt with the following features:

- Users can filter results by breed or age range
- Results are paginated
- Users can sort by the sortable fields: _breed_, _age_, and _name_
- Displays all of the result Dogs' information
- Users can select favorites to be shortlisted
  - Favorites are saved to sessionStorage to persist on page reload
  - Favorites can be viewed/removed
  - Users can generate a match based on their listed favorites

This app was built using React with Vite and Typescript.
